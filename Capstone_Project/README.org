* AI workflow template

This is a template for a coursera training I got. It is not much about
the ML algorithm. It is much more about the logic and the structure in
the project.

It covers unit tests, model containerization, model monitoring /drift
detection as well as the logic of EDA, hypothesis testing, features
engineering and model deployment that you should keep throughout AI
projects.

** TODO write the logic of the project so that you do not have to start each time from scratch
